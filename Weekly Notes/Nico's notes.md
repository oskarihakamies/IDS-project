## Weeks 5 & 6

I was supposed to be installing the whole idea of ours, 
test out the first working model and figure out how to Mount the ISO so that we can share it when the project is finished...

- I ran into a few problems during the installation - phase.
1st was finding the right installers for the actual software, f.ex Suricata.
After searching for a while, managed to find them. Install them, test out that they work individually. It was time to see if they work together but I ran into another trouble.

2nd issue was with the VM itself - which is what I'm troubleshooting now with a good friend of mine, Copilot.
